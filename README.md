# NOMME.
Mood based food recommendation system.
Nomme is an innovative food recommendation system designed to offer personalized meal suggestions based on the user's current mood. By analyzing mood indicators such as emotions, preferences, and past behaviors, Nomme tailors its recommendations to match the user's psychological state, whether they are feeling joyful, stressed, tired, or adventurous.
In addition to being mood-responsive, Nomme encourages mindful eating by offering nutritional tips, portion control suggestions, and time-appropriate dishes. The system can adapt to daily fluctuations in emotional states and recommend anything from hearty comfort food for a gloomy day to light, vibrant meals for when users feel energized and ready for new experiences. Nomme aims to transform everyday meal planning into a more emotionally fulfilling and personalized experience, helping users build a better relationship with food that caters to both body and mind.
